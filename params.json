What does that mean, exactly?\r\n\r\n## Autonomy, Awareness and Self-Expression\r\n\r\nMany software-intensive systems deployed today are large and complex, and they are often connected to the Internet which is even larger and more complex.  It is simply no longer possible to have operators continuously monitor the components of a system, tune it to the specific circumstances it encounters or diagnose malfunctions---these are things systems should do on their own.  Put another way, systems should be adaptive and able to operate autonomously.\r\n\r\nLet us look at an example: a swarm of rescue robots.  Imagine that after a natural disaster or an accident in an industrial plant, we can deploy robots that aid the human rescue parties by, e.g., exploring and mapping the terrain, securing dangerous structures, locating victims and transporting them to safety, or by sealing radioactive or toxic substances.  Clearly this has many benefits even if the robots are not autonomous but have to be remotely controlled by humans.  But the environment in disaster areas is often not conductive to remote control, as wires are likely to become physically damaged and wireless reception is often likely to be poor.  In addition, human experts are already under enormous pressure, so it would be advantageous if the robot swarm could operate autonomously.  This clearly requires the robots to adapt to a wide range of different, dynamically changing situations.\r\n\r\nThe bi question is, of course, how can we build these kinds of systems?  And in particular, how can we build them to be reliable even when they encounter circumstances that the designers have not foreseen, or, as is the case for the hypothetical rescue robots, when the designers don't even know very much about the environment in which the system will be operating.  After all, the rescue robots are not much help, if their actions endanger the victims or rescue personnel.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThe development of Poem was funded by the European ASCENS project (\"Software Engineering for *A*utonomic *S*ervice-*C*omponent *Ens*embles\").","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
