          <p>Behavior trees (BTs) are a technique for describing agent behaviors
that was introduced to allow designers to script the behavior of
non-player characters in computer games.  In its simplest form a BT is
a tree containing <em>actions</em> that are executed by an agent as
leaf nodes, and <em>choice nodes</em> and <em>sequence nodes</em> as internal
nodes.  Choice nodes allow the choice between different courses of
action whereas sequence nodes allow sequential execution of actions.
Each BT is periodically activated by the control loop of its
containing system (adopting a term commonly used in game engines, we say
it is <em>ticked</em>) and returns a result indicating that its
execution was either successful, that execution failed, or that it is
still running and needs more time to continue.  A choice node succeeds
when any of its child nodes succeeds and fails when all of its child
nodes have failed.  A sequence node fails whenever one of its children
fails and succeeds when all its children succeed.  Both choice and
sequence nodes return a running status whenever one of their children
does.</p>

<p>Many implementations of BTs exist; most of them extend the basic node
types with nodes such as <em>decorators</em>, internal nodes having a
single child and modifying the execution behavior of that child, e.g.,
by ``negating’’ the result (from succeeded to failed and vice versa).
Despite their simplicity, BTs allow surprisingly complex behaviors to
be specified, but they suffer from a number of well-known limitations,
for example: (1) Every action performed by the BT is immediately
executed so that possibilites for off-line planning are limited.
(2) It is difficult to implement state-based behaviors using BTs,
since the child nodes of each node have to be specified in the tree
which leads to clumsy specifications if different states require
different behaviors.</p>

<p>To address these issues we have introduced <em>Extended Behavior Trees (XBTs)</em>.  XBTs extend behavior trees in several ways, among them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The nodes return an indicator about the reward they obtained to
their parent in addition to the execution status.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A state object is threaded through the activations of the nodes.
All operations on the environment have to be mediated by the state,
e.g., by being implemented as methods of the state object.  States
can be <em>virtualized</em> so that operations on the state simulate
the expected behavior but do not change the real environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a node type <em>external choice node</em> that is similar
to choice nodes but calls a function to generate its child nodes
whenever it is ticked and not already running.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These extensions of behavior trees make it easy to specify state-based
behaviors and they permit reinforcement-learning and offline-planning
nodes.  In addition, the operational semantics of XBTs is defined by a
translation into SCEL and therefore node types that execute their
children concurrently are easy to define.</p>

<p>Fig. \ref{fig:xbt-robot} shows an XBT for a simple rescue robot.  The
topmost node is a choice between four alternatives: The leftmost
subtree checks whether the robot is in one of its home locations.  In
that case, it executes its child node, a sequence node that first
updates the robot’s data and then drops off the victim.  If this
alternative fails, either because the robot is not in a home location
or because it is not carrying a victim, the choice node proceeds to
the second subtree, checks whether there is a victim in the current
location and picks up the victim if possible.  If this branch of the
tree also fails and the robot is carrying a victim, it picks a home
location and moves towards this location, otherwise it picks a new
location where it expects to find a victim to rescue and moves towards
that location.</p>

<p>Returning a result status of ``running’’ is similar to yielding in a
coroutine: execution of the currently running branch of the XBT is
suspended and control returns to the control loop; when the XBT is
ticked again, it will resume execution starting with the suspended
node.  The possibility to fail and continue with the next choice leads
to a convenient handling of situations where the outcomes of actions
are not certain.</p>

<p><img src="images/xbt2.png" alt="External choice node for state-based behavior" /></p>

<p>Moving towards a target location is one example of state-based
behavior: the direction to a target depends on the current position of
the robot.  Fig. \ref{fig:xbt-nav} shows how external choice nodes can
address this situation: The state of the navigation graph provides a
sequence of waypoints that are possible targets for the next move of
the robot.  The external choice node tries to perform a <code>go</code>
action to each of these nodes in turn, until one action succeeds.  By
providing a sequence of waypoints, the system achieves a limited
amount of error tolerance: when some paths are blocked, the robot
tries to find alternative routes.  But this solution is rather
limited: the different waypoints may lead to greatly different rewards
or costs, and the experience of the robot from previous rescue
missions is not used to improve future behavior since there is no
feedback from the XBT back to the navigation graph.</p>

<p><img src="images/xbt3.png" alt="External choice node for Q-learning" /></p>

<p>It is easy to incorporate individual learning into XBT-based controllers to add additional flexibility: Fig. \ref{fig:xbt-rel} shows the movement XBT for a robot that autonomously learns the navigation decisions for unknown terrain.  This navigation system uses a <code>RL(Q)</code>-node, an external choice node that performs reinforcement learning using a Q-function.  This node receives the set of all possible next waypoints from the navigation graph and uses an estimate of their quality (provided by the Q-function) to choose the order in which they are tried.  Since the available Q-function is generally only an approximation of the real values obtained from the environment, the <code>RL(Q)</code> node uses the reward obtained by executing the <code>go(waypoint)</code> child node to update its estimate of the Q-function.  In addition, the <code>RL(Q)</code> node occasionally performs <em>exploration moves</em> to waypoints that are not optimal according to the current estimate in order to obtain a better estimate.  As can be seen by this example, it is straightforward to add individual learning behaviors to any choice node in an XBT.</p>
