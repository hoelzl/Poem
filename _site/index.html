<h2 id="a-language-for-designing-awareness-mechanisms">A language for designing awareness mechanisms</h2>

<p>Poem is a language for designing awareness mechanisms for adaptive,
autonomous systems. What does that mean, exactly?</p>

<h2 id="autonomy-awareness-and-self-expression">Autonomy, Awareness and Self-Expression</h2>

<p>Many software-intensive systems deployed today are large and complex,
and they are often connected to the Internet which is even larger and
more complex. It is simply no longer possible to have operators
continuously monitor the components of a system, tune it to the specific
circumstances it encounters or diagnose malfunctions—these are things
systems should do on their own. Put another way, systems should be
adaptive and able to operate autonomously.</p>

<p>Let us look at an example: a swarm of rescue robots. Imagine that after
a natural disaster or an accident in an industrial plant, we can deploy
robots that aid the human rescue parties by, e.g., exploring and mapping
the terrain, securing dangerous structures, locating victims and
transporting them to safety, or by sealing radioactive or toxic
substances. Clearly this has many benefits even if the robots are not
autonomous but have to be remotely controlled by humans. But the
environment in disaster areas is often not conductive to remote control,
as wires are likely to become physically damaged and wireless reception
is often likely to be poor. In addition, human experts are already under
enormous pressure, so it would be advantageous if the robot swarm could
operate autonomously. This clearly requires the robots to adapt to a
wide range of different, dynamically changing situations.</p>

<p>The bi question is, of course, how can we build these kinds of systems?
And in particular, how can we build them to be reliable even when they
encounter circumstances that the designers have not foreseen, or, as is
the case for the hypothetical rescue robots, when the designers don’t
even know very much about the environment in which the system will be
operating. After all, the rescue robots are not much help, if their
actions endanger the victims or rescue personnel.</p>
